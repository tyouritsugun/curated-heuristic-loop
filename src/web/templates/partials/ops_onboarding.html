      <strong>Start with data operations.</strong> Use Import to pull from Google Sheets and Export to push local edits out.
      Each trigger records the actor, lock status, and result in Job History.

      <strong>Watch queue + telemetry.</strong> The SSE stream refreshes queue status and recent jobs without reloading the page.
      If SSE is blocked, press the "Refresh" buttons on each card.

      <strong>Search uses keyword matching.</strong> In CPU-only mode, entries are immediately available for search after import.
      Use specific keywords from titles and content. See <a href="/doc/manual.md#9-cpu-only-mode" target="_blank">CPU-Only Mode docs</a> for search tips.

      Embeddings are generated automatically after import. Each trigger records the actor, lock status, and result in Job History.

    <li>
      <strong>Manage models as needed.</strong> The Model Management card lets you change embedding and reranker models.
      Model changes will automatically trigger re-embedding of all content (Phase 4).

      <strong>Watch queue + telemetry.</strong> The SSE stream refreshes queue depth, worker heartbeats (when available), and recent jobs without reloading the page.
      If SSE is blocked, press the "Refresh" buttons on each card.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Handle FAISS snapshots.</strong> Use the snapshot card to download the current index or upload a prepared ZIP (stays on disk, logged in audit trail).
      This is the safest way to move vectors between machines.
