      <p class="muted">Each card mirrors an API endpoint, so everything you do here is logged and protected by the same safety checks.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Start with the job controls.</strong> Use Import to pull from Google Sheets, Export to push local edits out, and Rebuild Index if embeddings drift.
      Each trigger records the actor, lock status, and result in Job History.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Manage workers only when you bring your own pool.</strong> The Worker Control card hides its buttons until a remote embedding service registers. Most setups rely on the FAISS snapshot card instead.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Watch queue + telemetry.</strong> The SSE stream refreshes queue depth, worker heartbeats (when available), and recent jobs without reloading the page.
      If SSE is blocked, press the “Refresh” buttons on each card.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Handle FAISS snapshots.</strong> Use the snapshot card to download the current index or upload a prepared ZIP (stays on disk, logged in audit trail).
      This is the safest way to move vectors between machines.
