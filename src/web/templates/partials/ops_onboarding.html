      <p class="muted">Each card mirrors an API endpoint, so everything you do here is logged and protected by the same safety checks.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Start with data operations.</strong> Use Import to pull from Google Sheets and Export to push local edits out.
      Embeddings are generated automatically after import. Each trigger records the actor, lock status, and result in Job History.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Manage models as needed.</strong> The Model Management card lets you change embedding and reranker models.
      Model changes will automatically trigger re-embedding of all content (Phase 4).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Watch queue + telemetry.</strong> The SSE stream refreshes queue depth, worker heartbeats (when available), and recent jobs without reloading the page.
      If SSE is blocked, press the "Refresh" buttons on each card.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Handle FAISS snapshots.</strong> Use the snapshot card to download the current index or upload a prepared ZIP (stays on disk, logged in audit trail).
      This is the safest way to move vectors between machines.
