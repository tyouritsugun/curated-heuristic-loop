# CHL System Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the Curated Heuristic Loop (CHL) system. The system uses SQLite database storage with optional vector search capabilities, while maintaining the core Generator/Evaluator workflow and providing team collaboration features through Google Sheets integration.

    participant Dev as Developer
    participant LLM as Code Assistant
    participant MCP as MCP Tools
    participant ES as Experience Service
    participant SS as Search Service
    participant DB as SQLite

    Dev->>LLM: Brief task with @generator.md
    LLM->>MCP: list_categories()
    MCP->>DB: Query categories
    DB-->>MCP: Category list
    MCP-->>LLM: Available categories

    LLM->>MCP: read_entries(entity_type, category_code, query)
    MCP->>ES: Get summaries
    ES->>DB: Query experiences
    DB-->>ES: Experience list
    ES-->>MCP: ID + title summaries

```



### Evaluator Mode (Write Path with Dedup)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant LLM as Code Assistant
    participant MCP as MCP Tools
    participant ES as Experience Service
    participant SS as Search Service
    participant DB as SQLite

    Dev->>LLM: Summarize with @evaluator.md
    LLM->>MCP: write_entry(entity_type, category_code, data)
    MCP->>ES: Create experience

    ES->>SS: find_duplicates(title, playbook)
    SS->>DB: Search similar entries
    DB-->>SS: Potential matches
    SS-->>ES: Scored duplicates

    alt High similarity (atomic experiences)
        ES-->>MCP: Suggest refactor into more orthogonal atomic entries (avoid merging)
        MCP-->>LLM: Propose refactor plan
        LLM->>Dev: Ask for confirmation
    else Integrative change (manuals)
        ES->>DB: Update category manual (keep concise)
        ES-->>MCP: Manual updated + notes
        MCP-->>LLM: Manual change suggested/applied
    else New atomic guidance
        ES->>DB: Create new atomic experience
        ES-->>MCP: Success (with similarity context)
        MCP-->>LLM: Entry created
    end

    LLM-->>Dev: Summary with actions
```



### Export/Sync Workflow (Team Collaboration)

```

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Search Abstraction Layer

Provider-based architecture allows swapping search implementations without changing the service layer.

**Interface Contract:**
- `search(query, category_code, top_k)` - Find experiences matching query text
- `find_duplicates(title, playbook, category_code, threshold)` - Detect similar entries before insert
- `rebuild_index()` - Reconstruct search index from database

**Implementations:**
- SQLite text provider using simple substring and exact-title matching (fallback)
- Vector provider backed by FAISS with optional reranking scores from the Qwen3 GGUF reranker (served via `llama-cpp-python`)

### 2. Knowledge Organization: Two Data Types

The CHL system organizes knowledge into two complementary data types:

#### Atomic Experiences
**Purpose**: Capture specific, focused patterns and heuristics that solve discrete problems.

**Characteristics**:
- **Focused**: Each experience addresses one specific pattern or approach
- **Orthogonal**: Experiences should have low relevance to each other
- **Actionable**: Contains concrete playbook steps
- **Structured**: Has sections (useful/harmful/contextual) with optional context
- **Anti-bloat**: When duplicates detected, refactor both experiences to be more atomic rather than merging

**Use Cases**:
- "Always validate user permissions before database mutations"
- "Use DB transactions for multi-step data changes"
- "Avoid N+1 queries in Laravel by eager loading relationships"

**Storage**: `experiences` table with 120-char title, 2000-char playbook

#### Category Manuals
**Purpose**: Store broader context, tutorials, and domain knowledge that doesn't fit into atomic experiences.

**Characteristics**:
- **Long-form**: No length limit on content
- **Contextual**: Provides background, explanations, and domain knowledge
- **Tutorial-style**: Can include step-by-step guides, architecture overviews
- **Complementary**: Works alongside atomic experiences to provide full picture

**Use Cases**:
- Laravel authentication architecture overview
- Database migration best practices and common patterns
- Frontend component organization philosophy
- Testing strategy and pyramid explanation

**Storage**: `category_manuals` table with 120-char title, unlimited content, optional summary

**IDs**: `MNL-<CATEGORY_CODE>-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSSmmm` (e.g., `MNL-FTH-20250115-104200123`)

**Workflow Integration**:
- LLM retrieves **manuals** during work sessions for broader context
- LLM retrieves **experiences** for specific, actionable patterns
- After session, LLM creates/updates **manuals** to capture conversation context
- LLM creates **experiences** only when specific, atomic patterns emerge

### Decision Guidelines: Experience vs Manual

- Use an **atomic experience** when guidance is focused, actionable, and testable on its own.
- Use a **manual update** when the change is integrative background, architecture rationale, or synthesis across multiple experiences.
- Keep manuals concise to preserve embedding/search quality; avoid dumping global atomic heuristics into manuals.
- On high similarity among experiences, prefer refactoring into more orthogonal entries instead of merging into broader ones.

### 3. SQLite Schema Design

**experiences** - Atomic patterns and heuristics
- Primary fields: id, category_code, section, title, playbook, context
- Provenance: source (local/global), sync_status (synced/pending/local_only), author
- Timestamps: created_at, updated_at, synced_at

**category_manuals** - Long-form context and domain knowledge
- Primary fields: id, category_code, title, content, summary
- Provenance: source (local/global), sync_status (synced/pending/local_only), author
- Timestamps: created_at, updated_at, synced_at

**embeddings** - Vector representations for search
- Links to experiences and manuals via entity_id and entity_type
- Stores serialized vectors
- Tracks embedding model version

**categories** - Category metadata
- Three-letter code + human-readable name

### 4. Provenance & State Management

**Source Field:**
- `local` - Created by individual developer, not yet reviewed
- `global` - Synced from published sheet, team-approved

**Sync Status States:**
- `synced` (0) - Local copy matches the latest published sheet after `chl sync` completes
- `pending` (1) - Needs human review (new local entry or modified global entry)
- `local_only` (2) - Personal preference, keep local only, exclude from exports

**State Transitions:**
- New local entry: `source='local', sync_status='pending'`
- Update global entry: `source='global', sync_status='pending'`
- After export: keep `sync_status='pending'` until published entries are imported
- Personal item: `sync_status='local_only'`
- After sync: `source='global', sync_status='synced'` and update `synced_at`

Whenever entries move to `synced`, record the current UTC timestamp in `synced_at` for traceability.

### 5. Duplicate Detection Strategy

**Philosophy: Atomic Experiences, Not Merging**

Duplicate detection is used to maintain a library of atomic, focused experiences:
- **Goal**: Prevent experience bloat and overlap
- **Approach**: When high similarity is detected, guide the LLM to refactor both the existing and new experiences to be more focused and orthogonal
- **Anti-pattern**: Avoid merging or updating experiences into broader, less specific entries

**Detection Thresholds**:
- `duplicate_threshold_update (0.85)`: High similarity - prompt LLM to refactor both experiences into atomic, orthogonal entries
- `duplicate_threshold_insert (0.60)`: Medium similarity - surface context to help LLM differentiate and maintain focus

**Workflow**:
- Detect similar experiences during write operations
- Present similarity scores and existing entries to the LLM
- Let the LLM decide how to refactor for atomicity
- Curator reviews ensure experiences remain focused and non-overlapping

### 6. Configuration Management

Configuration is loaded by `src/config.Config`, which reads environment variables directly and falls back to project defaults (database under `<experience_root>/chl.db`, FAISS index under `<experience_root>/faiss_index`, etc.). The helper also auto-creates the experience root directory when required, and resolves relative paths under `<experience_root>`.

**Configuration highlights:**
- Database path (`CHL_DATABASE_PATH`) and echo flag
- Experience root (`CHL_EXPERIENCE_ROOT`) which drives default paths for SQLite, FAISS, and model selection cache
- Duplicate detection thresholds (`CHL_DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD_INSERT`, `CHL_DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD_UPDATE`)
- Read limits for MCP tools (`CHL_READ_DETAILS_LIMIT`, used by read_entries)
- ML model overrides (`CHL_EMBEDDING_REPO`, `CHL_EMBEDDING_QUANT`, `CHL_RERANKER_REPO`, `CHL_RERANKER_QUANT`)
- Export & sync settings (Google credentials path, review/published sheet IDs)
- Inline embedding toggle (`CHL_EMBED_ON_WRITE`)
- Logging level (`CHL_LOG_LEVEL`) and optional author override (`CHL_AUTHOR`)



### 7. Layer Responsibilities

**MCP Tooling (src/mcp):**
- Tool handlers validate payloads, invoke repositories, kick off best-effort embeddings, and surface duplicate suggestions.
- Utilities provide consistent error payloads and small response helpers.

**Storage (src/storage):**
- SQLAlchemy models, repositories, and session management live here.
- SheetsClient wraps Google Sheets operations for export/import scripts and MCP helpers.
- Import/export helpers handle conflict resolution and sync status bookkeeping.

**Search (src/search):**
- `SearchService` orchestrates between the FAISS-backed provider and the SQLite text fallback.
- Providers implement `SearchProvider` for both vector and SQL-based searches, plus duplicate detection.
- `faiss_index.py` tracks vector IDs and incremental updates.

**Embedding (src/embedding):**
- `EmbeddingClient` and `RerankerClient` load Qwen3 GGUF models via `llama-cpp-python`.
- `EmbeddingService` coordinates repository writes, status updates, and FAISS maintenance.

**Operational Scripts (scripts/):**
- `setup.py`, `sync_embeddings.py`, `rebuild_index.py`, `export.py`, and `import.py` automate maintenance and data exchange.
- Shared settings live in `scripts/scripts_config.yaml`; scripts read that file by default but still accept CLI overrides.
- Run them via `uv run python â€¦` to reuse the managed environment.

## Technology Stack

**Storage:**
- SQLite - Embedded database
- SQLAlchemy - ORM for schema and queries

**Search:**
- SQLite text queries - fallback provider
- FAISS (via `faiss-cpu`) - vector index
- Qwen3 embedding & reranker models served by `llama-cpp-python`

**External Services:**
- gspread - Google Sheets API client
- google-auth / google-auth-oauthlib - Service account authentication

**Scripts/CLI:**
- Python maintenance scripts executed with `uv run python â€¦`

**MCP Server:**
- FastMCP - MCP protocol server framework

## Extension Points

**Search Providers:**
Vector FAISS is the standard provider; additional providers can still implement the `search/` interface if future requirements demand them.

**Export Formats:**
Extend export workflows in `storage/` with format-specific handlers (CSV, Notion, Markdown, etc.).

**External Integrations:**
Add clients in `integration/` for services like Notion, Linear, or custom embedding providers.

**Curator Workflows:**
Build on export/sync workflows in `storage/` for clustering, bulk operations, analytics dashboards, etc.

**GraphRAG Compatibility:**
The design intentionally remains compatible with future relationship graphs (GraphRAG). A relationships store (e.g., `relationships` table with typed edges) can be added later without changing MCP tool contracts; current phases avoid persisting relationships and surface only similarity context for human review.
