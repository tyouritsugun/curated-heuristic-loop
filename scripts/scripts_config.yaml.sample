# Configuration template for CHL maintenance scripts.
# Fill in the values that match your environment. CLI flags can still override
# these defaults when necessary. The Settings UI now reads Google credentials
# and sheet metadata directly from this file—nothing else to configure.

# Relative paths resolve from the directory containing this YAML.
# data_path → where SQLite, FAISS, and logs live. Keep the default unless your
# repo clones data elsewhere.
data_path: ../data
# google_credentials_path → point to the service-account JSON you created in the
# Google Cloud console (IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Keys). Copy that file
# into <experience_root>/credentials (the Settings page explains this) and
# reference it here.
google_credentials_path: ../data/credentials/your-service-account.json

# Optional override for the SQLite database filename (relative to data_path).
database_filename: chl.db
